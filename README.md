# Analog-WASD-Keyboard-kmk-pi-pico-rp2040

A Raspberry pi pico(rp2040) kmk keyboard with analog WASD input. 
Still work in progress. 

Added module: analouge.py (pins and threshold can be defined here till i implement it better)

keymap for analog keys can be defined it code.py -> ana.map = []

GOALS:
-analog input using magnetic switches(wooting lekker) and hall effect sensors as WASD
-normal and rapid trigger mode
